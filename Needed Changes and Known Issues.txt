- Some Pok√©mon Encounter Rarity doesn't display on the Area search tab, even though the data for it exists

- Live updater updates, but doesn't actually tell you a new version is out

\\ Changes to come

- Integrate a "Key" for the different colored rarities and methods of catch. Bake a button into the top near the "options" that says "Key" and gives a pretty layout of what everything means. (css included)


- Create your own rarity and method colors.

- Include pokemon natures somehow
